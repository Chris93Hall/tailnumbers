## About

This is a quick and dirty python module for looking up aircraft info from an aircraft's tailnumber. See ```example.py``` for usage.

## Data Source

The data source is a series of CSV files. The CSV files are public information published by the Federal Aviation Administration every year.

Data source: ```https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download```

Download the zip file, unzip the contents into a directory, and feed that directory path to the ```TailNumbers``` class.
